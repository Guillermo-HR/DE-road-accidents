## About the documentation
This project was developed as part of a learning journey in data engineering. The documentation is divided into two main sections:
1. **Project Documentation**: This section provides an overview of the project, including its structure, data sources, pipeline, architecture, and diagrams. It serves as a guide to understand how the project is organized and how it functions.
2. **Self-Learning Resources**: This section contains notes, tutorials, and resources that I used to learn the concepts and technologies applied in this project. 
To divide the documentation into these sections, I have created two diferent directories within the `docs/` folder:
- `project_documentation/`
- `self_learning_resources/`
